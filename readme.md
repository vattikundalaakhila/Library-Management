# 📚 Digital Library Management (Vanilla JavaScript)

A beginner-friendly **Digital Library Management** web application built using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**.  
This project is designed to practice **DOM manipulation, semantic HTML, CSS layout, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, and **browser storage** without using any frameworks or external libraries.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The Digital Library Management app helps users manage a personal book collection directly in the browser.

Users can:
- Add books
- View books
- Edit book details
- Delete books
- Mark books as Available or Borrowed
